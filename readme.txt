This plug-in is a plug-in that adds a number string that can grasp the heading hierarchy at the head of all headings created by h1 to h9 in the article.

== Description ==

This plug-in is a plug-in that adds a number string that can grasp the heading hierarchy at the head of all headings created by h1 to h9 in the article.
For example,
<.h1>test<./h1>
<.h2>test<./h2>
<.h2>test<./h2>
Let's say it is like this.
Then, on the article, a number string is added to the heading as follows.
1 test
1-1 test
1-2 test
In this way, the hierarchical structure of the heading is added to the head of the headline and it is displayed on the article.

In the user setting, it is possible to set "number" and "character between numbers" to be added to the headline.

xxxIt does not have to be a hierarchy from h1xxx

Since this plug-in allocates numbers based on the largest heading in the article,
There is no problem even if the biggest headline tag in the article is not h1.

For example

<.h2>test<./h2>
<.h3>test<./h3>
<.h3>test<./h3>

Even if you use heading tags in articles as in

1 test
1-1 test
1-2 test

And assign numbers.

このプラグインは記事内にあるh1~h9で作成された全ての見出しの先頭に、その見出しの階層が把握できる数字列を追加するプラグインです。
例えば、
<.h1>test<./h1>
<.h2>test<./h2>
<.h2>test<./h2>
のようになっているとします。
そうすると、記事上では以下のように見出しに数字列が追加されます。
1 test
1-1 test
1-2 test
このように見出しの階層構造を見出しの先頭に追加し、記事上で表示してくれます。

ユーザー設定では、見出しに追加する"数字"と"数字間の文字"を設定することが可能です。

xxx必ずh1からの階層でなくてもいいxxx

当プラグインは、記事中にある一番大きい見出しを基準に番号を割り振りますので、
記事中の一番大きい見出しタグがh1でなくても問題ありません。

例えば

<.h2>test<./h2>
<.h3>test<./h3>
<.h3>test<./h3>

のように記事中に見出しタグを使用していても、

1 test
1-1 test
1-2 test

と番号を割り振ります。
